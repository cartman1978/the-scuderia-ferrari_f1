# **The Scuderia Ferrari F1**

## **Goal for this project**

This website is for those who support  the myth and legend of the Scuderia Ferrari. No other Formula 1 team carried the history, the passion nor the romance that this great team does. It is a machine that consumes you. It is a family that embraces and protects you.

The Scuderia Ferrari F1 will make fans filter car by year, find information related to drivers, emgine size, races won and images.

### **Design Choices**

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to come up with a color scheme that matches the Ferrari F1 Team. I have decided to keep the design, the background will be white and  just recall Ferrari logo colors for buttons and navigation. The reason for this is because for this project the functionalities is more important.

#### Fonts

I have visited [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to explore and find the appropriate fonts to use. I have decide to use [Maven Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Maven+Pro) for the main text.

#### Structure

Yo create the website structure I decide to use [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).  Materialize provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page and they offer various features like floating action button, Navbar, Tables etc.
